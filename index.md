[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

I am a four time Founder. I created 2 SaaS companies: Dealer Ignition, Sales Ignition and CRM Refresh. I also founded Lux Skin Oils with my children to help teach them about startups. I bought Next Email Signatures and I am currently looking for more companies to purchase through Tenacious Capital. 

On this site I write some times about ideas, observations and thoughts. Sign up to get my infrequent posts via email.
